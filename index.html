          <h6>The main objective of this formula is to supply the body with the essential nutrients which maximize the efficiency of the results and uplift your overall health.</h6>

           <h6>The formula includes Gymnema sylvestre, biotin, chromium, and manganese, for example, four staples found in many other diabetes and blood sugar support supplements available today. Many doctors tell diabetics to take a chromium supplement or add more chromium to their diet, for example, because of its proven effects on weight loss.</h6>

           <h6>Some of these ingredients interact with your body’s hormones, stimulating your body to create more hormones (like insulin) to regulate blood sugar. Others interact with your arterial walls and blood vessels, widening them for better flood flow.</h6>
